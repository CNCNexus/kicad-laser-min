## kicad-laser-min

The application will take a PCB file generated by KICAD and create paths which will isolate all PCB tracks  from each other. This has the added benefit
of minimum laser travel.

### Usage

Usage: 
    Option: -m         Process map.png directly
            -f         Process Front Copper Layer. (default Bottom Copper Layer)
            -p<pxmm>   Change pixels per mm (default 30)

### Errors

Opencv follow contour sometimes does not make closed contours. This is a problem in PCB making, as it would short-circuit PCB tracks. 
However, as shown the inter-contour distance tolerance is of 0.0685mm. I have a laser cutter with an engraving width of 0.2mm (i.e. a
possible 0.1mm engraving width on the centre of track to a track coninciding from left or right side)

![However Distance is small enough to still function](https://github.com/micsche/kicad-laser-min/tree/master/images/error-2.png "Logo Title Text 2")

OpenCV follow contours creates two contours from both sides. ToDo: find own findcontour method. No real problem here, rather than
double time to process pcb.
