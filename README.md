## kicad-laser-min

The application will take a PCB file generated by KICAD and create paths which will isolate all PCB tracks  from each other. This has the added benefit
of minimum laser travel.

### Usage

Usage: 
    Option: -m         Process map.png directly
            -f         Process Front Copper Layer. (default Bottom Copper Layer)
            -p<pxmm>   Change pixels per mm (default 30)
